# 🌦 Weather Dashboard (Power BI + API Integration)

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that fetches and visualizes **real-time weather data** from an API.  
The dashboard allows users to compare weather conditions across multiple cities and analyze patterns such as **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall conditions**.

👉 This project is useful for:  
- 🌍 **Travelers** (plan trips based on weather)  
- 🏢 **Businesses** (logistics, supply chain, outdoor work planning)  
- 📊 **Learners & Data Enthusiasts** (understanding API integration with Power BI)  

---

## 🌐 Data Source
Instead of a static dataset, the weather data is **fetched directly from a live Weather API**.  
This ensures that the dashboard always stays **up-to-date with real-world conditions**.

---

## ❓ Key Insights
- 🌡 **Temperature trends** across selected cities  
- 💧 **Humidity levels** and comfort comparison  
- 💨 **Wind speeds** to monitor extreme weather  
- 🌥 **Weather conditions** (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)  
- 📊 **City-wise comparison** for multiple weather metrics  

---

## 🔄 Process
1. **API Integration**  
   - Fetched live data from a Weather API.  
   - Converted JSON response into a usable format.  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and structured API response for Power BI.  
   - Standardized fields such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.  

3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built interactive visuals for each weather parameter.  
   - Added comparison views between different cities.  

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - User-friendly design with slicers and filters.  
   - Real-time city-wise weather analysis.
